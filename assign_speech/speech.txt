Impromptu speech definition
An impromptu speech is given with little or no preparation, yet almost always with some advance knowledge on the topic. This is sometimes referred to as "off the cuff" or "spur of the moment".

In small informal meetings, the audience will interrupt an impromptu speech and ask questions, which helps guide the speech and the information that is presented.

When campaigning, politicians sometimes respond to reporters or voters almost anywhere and at any time.
